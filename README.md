# Node.js Unit Testing In-Depth
​A focused, in-depth look into Node.js unit testing, from absolute beginner to very advanced.

## Takeaway from the project
This is a focused, in-depth course about unit testing, where we will look at lots of code, and learn how to test it. We will go through everything from the simplest JavaScript function to ES6 classes & private code testing. We will also learn how to test your code coverage, so you always know where you stand.

One of the goals of this course is to teach you how to think about unit testing, and not simply teach you the basic syntax or how to call an assertion.

We will go through most scenarios you will run into day to day, as well as address a number of issues and examples ignored by most unit testing courses available online.

You should have some node experience, you don't need to be an expert, but you should at least know the basics.

* What you’ll learn
    Students will be well versed in how to unit test applications, they will be ahead of most other developers in that regard.
* Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?
    Basic knowledge of node is required.
* Who this course is for:
    All nodejs developers, or devs who wish to learn more about unit testing using node.
